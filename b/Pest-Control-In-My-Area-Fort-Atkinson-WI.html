Integrated pest management was conceived throughout the 1950s when insecticide resistance, nontarget impacts, and economic waste were clearly evident (Stern et al., 1959).</p>
<p>This brand-new design is anticipated to guide IPM strategies worldwide to develop and carry out sustainable farming practices to ensure success for the growers, cost to consumers, and food security to the growing world population.
