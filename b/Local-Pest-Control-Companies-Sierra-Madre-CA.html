<p>In recommendation to the idea of incorporating the use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on expanded to embrace coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).

<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal dosages of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience slowed down advancement and feeding and undergo higher parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). In other words, an efficient, nondisruptive way to handle a moderate beet armyworm outbreak may be to retard its advancement and damage while providing the parasitoids time to work, thus enhancing the parasitoids' impact during subsequent generations.</p>
