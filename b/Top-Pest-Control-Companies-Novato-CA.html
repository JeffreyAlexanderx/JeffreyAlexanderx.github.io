<p>Other pesticides, like surface area sprays and termite treatments, remain in the environment for days, weeks and even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential element of an integrated pest management programme. But by focusing on non-chemical alternatives first, you can guarantee that your pest management program is efficiently getting rid of pests at the least risk to your food security program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, it is also based on semiochemicals especially kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are driven away or discouraged away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are simultaneously brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ). The majority of pesticide problems are triggered by a little number of the pesticides available today.</p>
<p>Pesticide risks consist of severe, immediate toxicity to people and other non-target organisms; long-lasting or persistent toxicity such as cancer; and environmental contamination of the air, or ground and surface area water.
