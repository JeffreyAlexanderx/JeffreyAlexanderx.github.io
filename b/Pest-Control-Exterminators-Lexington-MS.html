Assessment is typically one of the most essential steps in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the procedure of evaluating an IPM program and the results it has generated.</p>
<p>Pest management needs a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used just after regular tracking suggests that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level. Lots of private commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to define what IPM suggests for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in restricted areas.</p>
