<p>The term "incorporated" was therefore associated with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular tracking suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the financial limit) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the cost of the control steps.</p>
<p>Pest control is an extremely important measure owing to the reality that a number of pests are providers of harmful disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the removal of a few pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are absolutely nothing brand-new to pest control-- pest control professionals often utilize pheromones traps as a means to keep track of pest populations-- including them to insecticides is a brand-new concept.</p>
<p>Normally, the primary objective of IPM programmes is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, originally developed for farming pest management, IPM programmes are now developed to include diseases, weeds, and other pests that might interfere with the management objectives of sites such as business and residential structures, lawn and turf locations, and home and community gardens.</p>
