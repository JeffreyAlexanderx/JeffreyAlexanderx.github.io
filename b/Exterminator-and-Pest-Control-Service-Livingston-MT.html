Biological control is a lot easier to carry out in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
<p>Chemical pesticides are classified into various groups based upon their mode of action (IRAC 2018) and rotating chemicals from different mode of action groups is suggested to minimize the risk of resistance development (Sparks and Nauen 2015 ).

To decrease possible harm to useful insects, restrict your spraying to small locations where you can see pests hiding, and leave a number of unsprayed "refuges" for any great bugs you can't see.</p>
