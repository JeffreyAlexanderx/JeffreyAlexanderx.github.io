Applicators carry out more intricate tasks, have the ability to utilize a wider variety of pesticides, and might focus on a certain area of pest control.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which enabled regional farmers to harness their native understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and usage of pest control actions that will guarantee favourable financial condition, ecological and social repercussions 13 and is applicable to many agricultural, public health and amenity pest management circumstances.</p>
