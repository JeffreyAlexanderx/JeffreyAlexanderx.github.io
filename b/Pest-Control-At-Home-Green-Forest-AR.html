<p>WebMD discusses natural alternatives for managing fleas and ticks on pets. The professional user must keep the use of pesticides and other forms of intervention to levels that are required, e.g. by minimized dosages, minimized application frequency or partial applications, thinking about that the level of danger in plants is appropriate and they do not increase the threat for development of resistance in populations of hazardous organisms.</p>
