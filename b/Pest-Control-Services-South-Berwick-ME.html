<p>More information is needed about food-chain concentration and useful methods of getting rid of destructive effects of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have actually served their function. Do not base pest management programs on total elimination of a pest. Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy berries and leaves originating from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds assaulting from the air.</p>
<p>If you ever see pests returning after treatment, Stay watchful and contact your pest control expert for a follow-up treatment. Modern crop ranges frequently unintentionally produce conditions which prefer pest species (e.g., pest species which have bored deeper into larger fruit making them unattainable to natural enemies).
