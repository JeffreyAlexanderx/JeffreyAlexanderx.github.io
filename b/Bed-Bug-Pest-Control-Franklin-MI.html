<p>Biological pest control steps benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary job is to establish appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and use controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural opponents helps to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control specialists even fix structural damage brought on by termites.</p>
<p>One ofthe most significant advantages of natural approaches is that they do not involve using toxicchemicals. Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if available; keep in mind, do not kill the useful insects.
