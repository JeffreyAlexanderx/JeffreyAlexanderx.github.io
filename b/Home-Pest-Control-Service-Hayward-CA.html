<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the ecosystem as a whole and considers a balanced mix of the aforementioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies a lot of the very same concepts as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to minimize the need for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides. </p>
<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal does of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience retarded advancement and feeding and undergo greater parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). In other words, a reliable, nondisruptive method to manage a moderate beet armyworm outbreak may be to retard its advancement and damage while providing the parasitoids time to work, consequently strengthening the parasitoids' effect during subsequent generations.</p>
