<p>If it was not widely adopted, all countries acknowledged IPM as a preferable approach to pest control even. Pests are a major hazard that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a waste of time and resources. Biological insecticides, derived from naturally happening microbes (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic fungis and entomopathogenic nematodes ), also fall in this classification.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep track of for pests and determine them properly, so that suitable control decisions can be made in conjunction with action thresholds. However, the major pattern has been towards making use of modern chemistry and molecular biology to replace traditional pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; however these methods are still therapies.</p>
