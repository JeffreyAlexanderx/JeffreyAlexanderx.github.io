Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an efficient mix of a wide range of management techniques including plant resistance, haven crops and effective sampling to call just a few.</p>

IPM is an approach to ensure economic practicality at both consumer and manufacturer level (seller is constantly anticipated to make a profit), ecological safety through a balanced usage of all readily available pest control choices, and social reputation given that IPM-based food is safe and cost effective.</p>
