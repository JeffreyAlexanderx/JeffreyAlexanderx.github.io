<h3>Why Pest Management Is Extremely Important Camp Lejeune NC</h3>
<p>But, we can certainly shed some light on the path to reliable pest control. Using insecticides when natural opponents are not abundant or are less vulnerable, such as when immatures are framed in host eggs, can be practical. Ants are pests around the house because they feed upon and contaminate human foods, infest structures, and build undesirable mounds in lawns.</p>
<p>Saved product pests are more than likely to be in a food active ingredient on delivery to a processing factory or a processed foodstuff when kept for a long period of time. Using pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a routine basis, despite requirement, is not IPM. The dependence on pesticides as a sole method of control has resulted in the development of insect resistance and negative effects on human health, natural enemies, and the environment.</p>
