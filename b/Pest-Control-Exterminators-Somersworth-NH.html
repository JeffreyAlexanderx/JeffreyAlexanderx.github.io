<p>Having some general concept of the expenses for various pest treatments services will certainly help you handle them on much better terms. D's has been my only option for over 15 years for pest and weed control as well as fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming arising from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides utilized in an organic system are as harmful to people and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control professionals can only do so much to protect the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The fact is, food business operators have to take an active role in integrated pest management by working closely with the experts.</p>
<p>However, thrips and other insect pests captured on yellow sticky cards are easier to observe than on blue sticky cards. Examples of working together organizations include, CEH Wallingford, Forest Research, Horticultural Development Company, The International Pesticide Application Research Centre, The Nature Museum London, Rothamsted Research Study, and Wye Bugs.</p>
