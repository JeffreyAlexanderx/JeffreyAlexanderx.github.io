<p>In IPM, pesticides are utilized just when needed and in mix with other techniques for more effective, long-term control. The advantages of GM crops extend beyond the reduction in insecticides, since they are compatible with other pest management tactics, particularly biological control. Identify the most efficient pesticide for your pest issue and make sure the pesticide you pick is designed for the pest you plan to utilize it on.</p>
<p>The success of control tactics should be measured using indicators based on monitoring of harmful organisms, beneficials, pesticide usage, and influence on the environment.
