<p>Pest management requires a holistic technique to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used only after regular monitoring shows that a pest population had actually reached an economic threshold level. Many private product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM suggests for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are available in minimal locations.</p>
<p>The severity and incidence of numerous plant illness can likewise be lessened by crop rotation, and choice of the planting site might affect the intensity of insect infestations.
