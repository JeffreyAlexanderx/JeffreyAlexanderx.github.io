<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the environment as an entire and thinks about a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least damaging strategy.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production uses a lot of the very same principles as IPM but restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to lower the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
<p>Pests managed: Yellow traps draw in whiteflies, fruit flies, male winged scales, leafhoppers, fungi gnats, midges, male winged mealybugs and leafminers, thrips, psyllids, and winged aphids.
