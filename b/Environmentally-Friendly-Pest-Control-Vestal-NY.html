<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the environment as an entire and takes into account a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>One ofthe biggest benefits of natural techniques is that they do not include the use of toxicchemicals. Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if available; keep in mind, do not eliminate the beneficial insects. However the exterminators not only assist you in getting rid of the pests from your house, but they make sure the pests will not return. IPM stresses making use of non-chemical control approaches, such as exclusion or trapping, before chemical alternatives.</p>
