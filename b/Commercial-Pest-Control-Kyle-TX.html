Integrated Pest Management or IPM, as it is commonly understood, is a system of handling pests which is designed to be sustainable.</p>
<p>One ofthe most significant benefits of natural methods is that they don't involve making use of toxicchemicals. Select a pesticide that is pest particular, if available; keep in mind, do not kill the useful insects.

IPM worries the use of non-chemical control methods, such as exclusion or trapping, before chemical alternatives.</p>
