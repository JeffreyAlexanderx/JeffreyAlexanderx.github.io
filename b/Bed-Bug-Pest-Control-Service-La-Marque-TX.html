When trying to find a location to infest, pests choose to hide in a place that supplies food and a safe breeding ground.

<p>The decision of the correct reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively impact natural enemies than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for specific insect species or life phases.</p>
<p>Other persistent and emerging pest issues include vectored human and animal diseases such as West Nile infection, Eastern equine sleeping sickness and Lyme disease; plant pests and illness such as emerald ash borer and soybean rust; and more than 170 noxious aquatic, terrestrial or parasitic weeds continue to challenge pest managers in the U.S. and elsewhere, and need efficient pest management measures.</p>
