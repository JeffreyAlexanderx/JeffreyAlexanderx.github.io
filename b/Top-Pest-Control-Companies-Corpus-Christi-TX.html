<p>Biological pest control measures benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial job is to develop acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Understanding of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural enemies helps to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control service technicians even fix structural damage triggered by termites.</p>

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) integrates various kinds of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to traditional synthetic pesticides-- in a practical, long-lasting plan. Biopesticides are generally compatible with natural enemies, but there are exceptions.</p>
