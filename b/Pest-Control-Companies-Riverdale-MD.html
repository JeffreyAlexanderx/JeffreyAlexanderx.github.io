<p>Each time the crop is searched, record arthropod pest numbers, area within the greenhouse, and the variety of plants examined. It's possible that the duplicated use of pesticides may be more hazardous in the long term than the pests themselves. Preferably, these thresholds adjust for modifications in market value, stage of crop growth, cost of pesticides, etc., but in reality most are based upon fixed infestation or damage levels.</p>
<p>A strategy that includes making use of pest-tolerant and pest-resistant cultivars developed through traditional breeding or genetic modification (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars have physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that reduce the plant's beauty or viability for the pest to feed, develop, or reproduce successfully.</p>
