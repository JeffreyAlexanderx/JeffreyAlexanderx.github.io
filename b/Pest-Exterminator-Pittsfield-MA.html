In essence, the linking of IRM and IPM offers a management viewpoint that is the very same as long-term, areawide pest management (Elliott et al., 2008). A pest control company does not just go directly to removing pests.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove since growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement.
