<p>So, pest control need to be carried out at the time you have even observed the sign of pest problem at your facility. Do securely and correctly utilize pesticides.

<p>Biological pest control measures make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial task is to establish appropriate pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural opponents assists to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions.
