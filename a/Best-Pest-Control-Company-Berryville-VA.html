<p>For instance, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, handle, and decrease risk from pests and pest management tools and strategies in a way that minimizes overall financial, health, and ecological threats.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies much of the same concepts as IPM however restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to minimize the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
<p>The many varying dangers from pests make it recommended for cultural heritage companies to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures. In these nations, routine usage of pesticides is limited to high worth (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly fixated cotton, soybean, sugarcane, and rice.</p>
