Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically solely about decreasing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management methods are unable to keep an insect pest population below an economic threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 500 types of insects, spiders, and mites have developed some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the form of a solid, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests choose crops like maize, sunflower, okra (woman finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a bigger environment and handles both with the big picture in mind.</p>

Examples consist of growing of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, selection of planting sites, trap crops, and changing the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
<p>Store pesticides in their original containers.
