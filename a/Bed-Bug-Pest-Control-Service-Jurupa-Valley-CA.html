<p>The entrance holes of some bug are smaller than can be seen by the human eye, so there may be no noticeable damage to packaging including pests. Pests engage with each other, the crop, and the environment. Biological controls-- Natural biological processes and materials can provide control, with appropriate environmental effect, and frequently at lower expense.</p>
<p>It is also apparent from many discussions with growers and pest control experts in California that resistance management viewed as turning pesticides among different mode of action groups is typically viewed as IPM, although resistance management is just a part of IPM. Pest control is the policy or management of a species specified as a pest, a member of the animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human activities.</p>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents.

<p>This details, in mix with offered pest control methods, is used to manage pest damage by the most cost-effective ways, and with the minimal hazard to people, property, and the environment.
