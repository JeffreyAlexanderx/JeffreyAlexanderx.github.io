In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest efficient dose when other approaches of pest control have stopped working.

Chemical controls were to be used just after regular tracking showed that a pest population had reached a level (the financial threshold) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the expense of the control procedures.</p>
<p>Chemical pesticides are classified into different groups based upon their mode of action (IRAC 2018) and rotating chemicals from different mode of action groups is recommended to reduce the danger of resistance advancement (Sparks and Nauen 2015 ). Government guidelines limit the time and amount of specific chemical pesticides and help alleviate the associated risks.</p>
