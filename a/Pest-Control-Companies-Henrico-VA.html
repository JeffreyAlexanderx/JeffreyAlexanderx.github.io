This stops the pest gaining resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to client houses and organisations to examine for insects or rodents. Classical biological control involves introducing natural enemies from a pest's native variety into a brand-new area where native natural opponents do not provide control.</p>
<p>Do not keep too many plants or haphazard bundles of documents as wetness and cellulose attract termites.
