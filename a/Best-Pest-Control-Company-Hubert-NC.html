<p>Unsure how to eliminate cockroaches? Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household bug pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about reducing pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management strategies are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is warranted.</p>

While chemical pesticides should be used as the last option, in principle, in some cases they are the very first line of defense to avoid the area-wide spread of certain endemic or intrusive pests and illness or to safeguard the seed and transplants from typical and relentless pest issues.</p>
<p>For that reason, pest management practices on one crop can straight or indirectly affect the other. Pest control is severe business, one that you shouldn't be managing yourself.

<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and prevent pest perseverance consist of intercropping (several crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
