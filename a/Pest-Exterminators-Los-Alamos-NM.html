<p>Pest control is an incredibly essential procedure owing to the truth that a number of pests are providers of harmful disease-causing bacteria. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the removal of a few pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are absolutely nothing brand-new to pest control-- pest control professionals regularly utilize pheromones traps as a way to keep track of pest populations-- including them to insecticides is a new principle.</p>
<p>A biological control program can be successful if these recommendations are followed: 1) properly identify all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural enemies from a reliable biological control provider, 3) ensure there is a constant supply of high quality natural opponents, 4) highlight that correct shipping treatments be followed, and 5) obtain directions from biological control providers on appropriate release rates and timing of application.</p>
