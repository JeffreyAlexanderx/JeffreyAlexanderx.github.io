Examples of teaming up organizations consist of, CEH Wallingford, Forest Research, Horticultural Development Company, The International Pesticide Application Research Study Centre, The Natural History Museum London, Rothamsted Research, and Wye Bugs.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the best for other organisms and for air, water, and soil quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds rather of a whole area.
