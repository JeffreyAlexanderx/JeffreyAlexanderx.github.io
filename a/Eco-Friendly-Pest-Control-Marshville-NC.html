Fungus: Beauveria bassiana is utilized for control of lepidopterous pests. The interactions in between crop and pest (along with the environment) are very important. Promotion of natural enemies: Not using pesticides and diversifying crops benefits natural opponents of cotton pests such as birds, ladybirds, beetles, spiders, parasitic wasps, bugs and ants.</p>
<p>Many newer pesticides are originated from plants or naturally taking place substances (e.g.-- bug, nicotine and pyrethrum juvenile hormone analogues), however the toxophore or active part might be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability.
