Although particular crop production and security methods are considered exclusive info, sharing knowledge and resources with each other will improve pest control effectiveness and benefit the whole grower community.</p>
<p>This information, in mix with available pest control techniques, is utilized to handle pest damage by the most economical methods, and with the least possible risk to individuals, property, and the environment.
