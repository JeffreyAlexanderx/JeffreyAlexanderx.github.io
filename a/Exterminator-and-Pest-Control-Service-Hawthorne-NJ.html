<p>Biological pest control measures benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial job is to develop acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural enemies assists to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions.

<p>The determination of the appropriate cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides poisonous to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively affect natural enemies than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect types or life phases. </p>

To reduce possible damage to advantageous insects, limit your spraying to little locations where you can see pests hiding, and leave a number of unsprayed "sanctuaries" for any good bugs you can't see.</p>
