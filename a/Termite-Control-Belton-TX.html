<p>Family pests like ants, cockroaches, and rodents can be far more than a nuisance - they can become a hazard to your property and potentially your health.

Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance. </p>
